A several days ago, a friend send a post from Yegor's
[blog][yegor-blog]. There, I found valuable insights in the several posts I read.

I also found some statements I disagree with. Yegor's
[published][pimp-your-resume] advice of how to pimp you resume got me
thinking. Not just thinking, it got me acting. I rewrote my cv to fit
into one page. I stated this blog. I really like the idea of sharing
my thoughts and insides with the rest of the world. For me, this is a
way to get valid feedback when I am wrong or not understood. It's also
a path to mastery: "by teaching, we learn".
